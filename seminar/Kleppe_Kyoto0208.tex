{\bf Abstract} Let $H(d,g)$ be the Hilbert scheme of curves of degree $d$ and
arithmetic genus $g$ in some projective space $\bf P$ and let $\bf H_X$ be the
local Hilbert functor of flat deformations $X_S \subset {\bf P} \times S$, S a
local artinian $k$-algebra, at a fixed curve $X$. An effective method of
studying the local ring of $H(d,g)$ at $(X)$ with respect to e.g. smoothness
and dimension, is to look at other local deformation functors $\bf D$ over
$\bf H_X$, $\bf D \rightarrow \bf H_X$, which allow a surjective tangent map
$t_{\bf D} \rightarrow t_{\bf H_X} = H^0({\it N}_X)$ and a corresponding
injective map of obstruction spaces. We consider several such deformation
functors $\bf D$ which determine $H(d,g)$ locally under various assumptions.
In particular we look to the functor {\bf (1)} of deformations of a pair
$(X,Y)$ where $X \subset Y$, {\bf (2)} of graded deformations of the
homogeneous coordinate ring of $X$ and {\bf (3)} of deformations of a pair
$(X,\xi)$ where $\xi$ is an extension in the Serre-correspondence \vskip 5 pt

I_X \otimes L \rightarrow 0 \ .$} \vskip 5 pt The latter allows us to prove
results for the moduli space of stable reflexive sheaves of rank 2 on ${\bf
P}$. Moreover by making some cup products explicit we get necessary and
sufficient conditions for the unobstructedness of some classes of reflexive
sheaves on ${\bf P^3}$.
